I work as a freelance controller, love to make and check financial plans in elaborate spreadsheets.  I like  practising yoga and meditation. I love singing in the Gay Men's Chorus of Amsterdam Manoeuvre. I enjoy travelling in exotic destinations like Cuba, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Iran, USA, Myanmar, Filippines and hopefully in the future Australia, South Africa and China. 
I LOVE the music of the Eurovision Song Contest and pop music of the 70's till now with favorites like ABBA, Whitney Houston, Diana Ross, Linda Ronstadt, Olivia Newton John and the Common Linnets. I simply love movies and tv series so Netflix has become a way of enjoying life even more next to cinema. Spiritual awareness of Life guides me.  
As a music hobby I do music as a dj at wedding parties, birthday celebrations and company meetings. 
Come and relax in my B&B room, I hope to give you a comfortable stay. I advise you to explore Amsterdam on a bike.  Feel@home in IAmsterdam!
